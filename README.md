# 2D Platformer

This game, in pre-alpha, is a pixel art 2D side-scroller with graphics and sound.

This is a relatively complete pre-alpha, although a fish
that can jump, swim on slopes, fire bullets,
interact with enemies, and more, is sort of wacky.
In the future, blubby will be further fleshed out into a
character with swimming animations in a fish bowl. Stick
around to see our progress!

You will find most of the game's content in the `level.tscn` scene.
You can open it from the default `game.tscn` scene, or double
click on `level.tscn` in the `src/level/` directory.

Language: C#/GDScript

Renderer: Compatibility
